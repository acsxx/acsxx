👋 Hi, I’m Ali. I'm a passionate Backend Engineer with over four years of experience designing, building, and optimizing scalable backend systems.
🚀 I specialize in backend development using Java (Spring Boot), Node.js (Express.js), and databases such as PostgreSQL, OracleSQL, Redis, and MongoDB.
🌍 I'm also experienced in DevOps practices, working with Docker (Compose), Jenkins, Linux systems, and Cloudflare to streamline CI/CD processes and deployments.
💡 I have hands-on experience with front-end development, using TypeScript, Nuxt3, Vue.js, and JavaScript when needed.
📚 I'm always eager to learn and improve my backend development and DevOps skills.
